# TextModifier
## Text Modifier is text based utility in which one can analyze the text and modify it accordingly.
This is built using React (create-react-app)
This is my very first react application :)<br />

#### Note:- <br />
Since gh-pages doesn't go well with react routers so currently in the project I had disabled them.<br />
But if u wanna see the project with routers then do the following:<br />
1. Clone the repository<br />
2. Open the folder in VS code<br />
3. In App.js (inside src folder) just remove the comments <br />
4. In Navbar.js(inside src/components folder) replace a with Link and href with to and remove the comments and in to write the route path. <br />
5. In terminal run npm start.
